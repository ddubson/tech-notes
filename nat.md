# Network Address Translation \(NAT\)

* Network Address Translation \(NAT\) - requires a network device capable of handling public-to-private IP address mappings
* How it works
  * an organization could have one or two public IP addresses, public IP addresses can be dynamically mapped to internal private IP addresses during the comm. session.
  * static NAT creates a persistent mapping of a public IP address to a private one.
* NAT enables the organization to hide its internal IP address range from external networks and clients.
  * Can prevent attacks on hosts
  * Can prevent IP spoofing of hosts
