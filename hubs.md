# Hubs

Essentially a repeating device, in which packets that are coming in one port are replicated to every other port \(i.e. 4-port hub will broadcast packets to all ports as they come in\).

* a lot of unnecessary traffic
* If there was a collision, hubs would repeat the collision downstream

* Hubs are only operable in \*half-duplex mode\*- they cannot send and receive data at the same time.

Hub is generally a box with multiple RJ-45 ports.

Hubs range from very small 4-port devices to larger 48-port ones designed for rack mounting.

Hubs can generated a lot of unnecessary network traffic and are capable of operating only in \*half-duplex mode\* \(cannot send and receive data at same time\) - 

* not used in modern high-density networks \(switches are used instead\)
* Hub is a repeating device that operates on the physical layer \(layer 1\) - transmits packets sent from one port and transmits to every other port on the device.
