# Subnetting and Masking

* Networks grow and messaging on the network grows as well, slowing down as it grows.
* Rule of thumb for size of network
  * about 100 nodes per subnet
  * about 30 nodes for very intense applications
* Classes A, B, and C are for user networks

* Each class has a default value
* The network mask \(subnet mask\)
  * where there are 1s indicates the network ID
  * where the 0s are the host ID
* Masks
  * A: 255.0.0.0
  * B: 255.255.0.0
  * C: 255.255.255.0
* Netmask has two parts
  * network specific
  * host specific
* Defined by Address Class type
* Subdivide the network into subnetworks
  * each with fewer hosts
* **Subnet** - LAN connected to other LANs via some internet working device \(e.g. router\)
  * Broadcasts are restricted to a subnet
  * All hosts on a subnet \(LAN\) can communicate with MAC addresses
  * Network layer \(IP\) addresses are required to communicate with hosts on other subnets \(LANs\)
* Subnet scheme:
  * Network specific address
  * Sub-network address
  * Host address
* Extend the 1s into the host ID portion - borrowing from the host ID to give us more smaller networks.![](/assets/subnet-2.png)
* Each subnet is a network, must have a router to get out
  * Directed broadcast
  * Limited broadcast
  * Network id
  * Range of usable host addresses
* Supernetting/Aggregation
  * Used to connect multiple small addresses to larger address space
  * Steal bits from the network id portion
* Break up 192.168.1.0 network into 4 groups
  * 1st subnet will be 0-63 -&gt; masked by 255.255.255.0
  * 2nd subnet will be 64-127 -&gt; masked by 255.255.255.64
  * 3rd subnet will be 128-191 -&gt; masked by 255.255.255.128
  * 4th subnet will be 192-255 -&gt; masked by 255.255.255.192

* Divide up networks into logical separate subnetworks \(subnets\).
* Subnetting takes the default address classes â€” A, B, C and can divide up those networks based upon the number of bit in the /subnet mask/ - used to tell a host which part of its IP address represents the network ID and which part reps the host ID
* e.g. In an ordinary class C address, the default mask is 255.255.255.0 \(24-bit\).
  * With an IP address of 192.121.14.7, we know the host is on 192.121.14.0 network, and there are 254 possible host addresses for the network \(0 is reserved for the network ID and 255 is reserved for cast\)
  * If we were to subnet, separating the network into two, we would have a new subnet mask of 255.255.255.128 \(25-bit mask\) - this gives us two new network IDs - 192.121.14.0 and 192.121.14.128 - each network has at most 126 hosts![](/assets/subnet-3.png)
