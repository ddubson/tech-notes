# Incident Response

**Security Event - **observable occurrences that relates to a security function

* User accesses a file
* Admin changing permissions
* Attacker conducting a port scan

**Adverse Event - **a security event with negative consequences

* Malware infection
* Server crash
* User accessing a file with no permissions

**Security Incident **- violation or imminent threat of violation of:

* Computer Security policies
* Acceptable Use policies
* Standard Practices and Procedures

e.g.

* Accidental loss of information
* Intrusion into computer system via backdoor
* Use of keylogger to steal information
* \(D\)DoS attack

Team responsible for handling security related events and incidents are known as Computer Security Incident Response Team \(CSIRT\)

## Phases of Incident Response

#### [Incident Response Process \(NIST SP800-61\)](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf)![](/assets/incident-res-1.png)Preparation

NIST recommended incident response toolkit:

* Digital forensic workstations
* Backup devices
* Laptops for data collection, analysis, reporting
* Spare server and networking equipment
* Blank removable media
* Portable printer
* Forensic/printer capture software
* Bootable USB media with forensic tools
* Office supplies/evidence collection materials

#### Detection and Analysis

NIST SP800-61 major categories of security event indicators:

* **Alerts **- originate from intrusion detection systems, SIEMs, AV software, file integrity checking
* **Logs** - generated by OS, services, applications, network devices, network flows.
* **Publicly Available Information **- new vulnerability and exploits announcements
* **People** - insiders and outsiders who report suspicious activity

Recommendations on Incident Analysis

* Profile networks and systems to measure the characteristics of expected activity.
* Understand 'normal' behavior of users, systems, networks, and applications
* Create a logging policy for all inputs
  * Retention period
  * Central location
* Perform event correlation to combine info from multiple sources \(SIEMs\)
* Synchronize clocks amongst servers, network devices
* Maintain an organization wide knowledge base on systems and applications
* Capture network traffic as soon as an incident is suspected
* Filter information to reduce clutter
* Seek assistance from external sources

#### Containment, Eradication, Recovery

1. Incident Validation
2. Containment
3. Eradication
4. Recovery

#### Post-Incident Activity

Conduct lessons learned / retrospective

NIST recommended retro:

* What happened + why?
* How well did the staff respond?
* Were procedures followed?
* What information was needed sooner?
* Were any steps taken that might've inhibited the recovery?
* What would be done differently next time?
* How could information sharing be improved?
* What corrective actions be taken?
* What precursors or indicators should be watched in future?
* What additional tools/resources are needed?

#### Evidence Retention

Follow retention policies

Consult with attorneys/law enforcement about evidence handling

U.S. federal government must retain all incident handling records for at least 3 years.

## Incident Response Policy

Serves as cornerstone of organization's incident response program

Should be written to:

1. Guide efforts
2. Provide authority for response

Approved at highest levels

Policy is not a place to describe specific technology or procedures

NIST recommends:

* Statement of management commitment
* Purpose + objectives of policy
* Scope of policy
* Definition of cybersec incident terms
* Organizational structure
* Prioritization / severity rating scheme
* Performance measures for CSIRT
* Reporting and contact forms.

#### Procedures and Playbooks

Procedures provide detailed tactical information that CSIRT members use when responding to incidents.

Playbooks are specific procedures for specific type of events:

e.g. breach of personal info, web server defacement, phishing attacks, etc.
