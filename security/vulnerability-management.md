# Vulnerability Management

Seeks to identify, prioritize, remediate vulnerabilities before attacker can exploit.

## Identify Requirements

Requirements may come from:

* Regulatory Constraints
  * HIPAA
  * GLBA
  * FISMA
  * PCI-DSS
* Internal Policy
  * Organization policy on addressing vulnerabilities

PCI-DSS

* 11.2 - Organizations must run internal and external scans on at least a quarterly basis OR after any "significant" change in network config.
* 11.2.1 Internal scans must be conducted by qualified personnel and must remediate any high-risk vulnerabilities, repeat scan thereafter.
* 11.2.2 External scans must be run by an Approved Scanning Vendor authorized by PCI-SSC

FISMA

Systems classified as: **Low**, **Moderate, or High** impact

All systems must meed basic requirements.

## Identify Scan Targets \(Planning\)

Identify systems covered by the vulnerability scans

Cybersec analysts use tools to search network for connected systems to build **asset inventory**

Tools such as:

* QualysGuard
* Tenable Nessus
* Rapid7 Nexpose
* Nikto Web App Scanner
* Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer

###### Scanning Frequency

Factors for frequency

* Organizations risk appetite
* Regulatory requirements
* Technical constraints
* Business constraints
* Licensing limitations

###### Configuring/Executing Vulnerability Scans

**Scoping **-&gt; extent of scan

determine which targets, vulnerability tests, and technical measures employed.

**Sensitivity Levels **- types of checks scanner will perform \(soft vs intense scanning\)

**Scan Perspectives** - conducting scans from variety of contexts

* From Internet
* Within Internal Network
* Inside Data Center

**Security Content Automation Protocol \(SCAP\)** - standardization for communicating security information

## Remediation Workflow

Scans reveal issues that need to be:

* Prioritized
* Tracked
* Remediated
