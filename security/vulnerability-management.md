# Vulnerability Management

Vulnerability management seeks to identify, prioritize, remediate vulnerabilities before attacker can exploit.

## Identify Requirements

Requirements may come from:

* Regulatory Constraints
  * HIPAA
  * GLBA
  * FISMA
  * [PCI-DSS](/security/infosec/governance/control-frameworks.md#pci-dss)
* Internal Policy
  * Organization policy on addressing vulnerabilities

PCI-DSS

* 11.2 - Organizations must run internal and external scans on at least a quarterly basis OR after any "significant" change in network config.
* 11.2.1 Internal scans must be conducted by qualified personnel and must remediate any high-risk vulnerabilities, repeat scan thereafter.
* 11.2.2 External scans must be run by an Approved Scanning Vendor authorized by PCI-SSC

FISMA

Systems classified as: **Low**, **Moderate, or High** impact

All systems must meed basic requirements.

## Identify Scan Targets \(Planning\)

Identify systems covered by the vulnerability scans

Cybersec analysts use tools to search network for connected systems to build **asset inventory**

Tools such as:

* QualysGuard
* Tenable Nessus
* Rapid7 Nexpose
* Nikto Web App Scanner
* Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer

###### Scanning Frequency

Factors for frequency

* Organizations risk appetite
* Regulatory requirements
* Technical constraints
* Business constraints
* Licensing limitations

###### Configuring/Executing Vulnerability Scans

**Scoping **-&gt; extent of scan

determine which targets, vulnerability tests, and technical measures employed.

**Sensitivity Levels **- types of checks scanner will perform \(soft vs intense scanning\)

**Scan Perspectives** - conducting scans from variety of contexts

* From Internet
* Within Internal Network
* Inside Data Center

**Security Content Automation Protocol \(SCAP\)** - standardization for communicating security information

## Remediation Workflow

Scans reveal issues that need to be:

* Prioritized
* Tracked
* Remediated

##### Prioritizing Remediation

* Criticality of systems affected
* Difficulty of remediating vulnerability
* Severity of vulnerability \(CVSS\)
* Exposure of vulnerability

##### Testing and Implementing Fixes

Sandbox environment first to test out potential fixes

### Common Vulnerability Scoring System \(CVSS\)

Vulnerabilities are scored on six different measures

* **Access Vector \(AV\)**
  * Local - must have physical/logical access to system \(0.395\)
  * Adjacent Network - must have access to local network \(0.646\)
  * Network - exploit remotely over network \(1.00\)
* **Access Complexity \(AC\) **- difficulty of exploiting the vulnerability
  * High - specialized config that is difficult to find \( 0.350\)
  * Medium - somewhat specialized conditions \(0.610\)
  * Low - does not require any special conditions \(0.710\)
* **Authentication \(Au\)** - hurdles that an attacker would need to clear the exploit
  * Multiple - 2+ auth structures to exploit \(0.450\)
  * Single - 1 auth structure to exploit \(0.560\)
  * None - no auth to exploit \(0.704\)
* **Confidentiality \(C\)** - type of info that can be disclosed
  * None - no confidentiality impact \(0.0\)
  * Partial - some info at risk \(0.275\)
  * Complete - all information is compromised \(0.660\)
* **Integrity \(I\)** - info alteration that might occur
  * None - no integrity impact \(0.0\)
  * Partial - some info altered \(0.275\)
  * Complete - all info altered \(0.660\)
* **Availability \(A\)** - disruption to info systems
  * None - no availability impact \(0.0\)
  * Partial - some availability affected \(0.275\)
  * Complete - wholly unavailable \(0.660\)

e.g. short hand:

```
CVSS2#AV:N/AC:M/AU:M/C:P/I:N/A:N
```

To prioritize a vulnerability properly, calculate the **CVSS base score**

CVSS Base Score is based on 3 factors

Exploitability Score

```
20 * AccessVector * AccessComplexity * Authentication
```

Impact Score

```
10.41 * (1 - (1 - Confidentiality) * (1 - Integrity) * (1 - Availability)
```

Impact Function

```
If Impact is 0:
    ImpactFn = 0
else:
    ImpactFn = 1.176
```

**CVSS Base Score** then is:

```
((0.6 * Impact) + (0.4 * Exploitability - 1.5) * ImpactFn
```

### Categorizing CVSS Base Scores

e.g. Nessus

| CVSS | Risk Category |
| :--- | :--- |
| &lt; 4.0 | Low |
| &gt; 4.0, &lt;= 6.0 | Medium |
| &gt; 6.0, &lt;= 10.0 | High |
| &gt; 10.0 | Critical |
