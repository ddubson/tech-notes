## Types of Wireless Attacks

### Rogue Access Points

Attack involving setting up a fake Access Point \(AP\) to attract unsuspecting victims to connect to it in thinking of using a free internet hotspot.

Also known as an **evil twin attack** in which the AP's SSID is very similar to a legitimate AP but with much less authentication barriers that lead victims to use the open alternative.

Also known as **EvilAP Attack**
