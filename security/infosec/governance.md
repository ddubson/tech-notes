# Security Governance

**Governance** is the set of overarching rules, regulations, policies, and other directives that dictate how the organization and employees conduct themselves.

## Laws and Regulations

* Laws and regulations established by regulatory bodies, statutes, and case law.
* Laws come from national, regional, state, and city levels

## Organizational Governance

* Typically created to establish orgs commitment to the law
* Describes requirements levied on personnel relating security behavior and mandates how the organization will comply with laws.

    * Do not describe how a requirement is to be implemented.
  * **Standards**

  * **Procedures**
    * complete the 'how' portion of compliance by discussing how personnel must meet the requirements of a policy
  * **Guidelines**
    * Usually optional
    * documents that describe alternative methods of implementing a requirement or procedure; may present best practices or optional information that is encouraged to be used.
