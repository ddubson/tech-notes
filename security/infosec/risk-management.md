# Risk Management

**Risk** - potential for harm to orgs, people, and info processing assets.

Risk consists of: Assets, vulnerabilities, threats, threat agents, likelihood, and impact.

* Asset - anything of value to an organization
* Vulnerability - weakness in a system or process
  * Implies the absence of a countermeasure
  * Vulnerabilities are internal and more easily managed.
* Threat - the possibility that vulnerability might be exploited which will introduce loss
  * Internal threats are somewhat controllable
  * External threats are much less controllable
  * Threat exploits a vulnerability
* Threat Agent - active ingredient that causes loss, something that initiates or causes a threat to occur
* Risk - produced when vulnerability and related threat are present
  * Quantified by combo of likelihood and impact
  * If there is no threat, or no vulnerability, there is no risk
* Exposure - reduce the attack surface or exploitable area
* Loss - compromise of the CIA, negatively affecting profits
* Countermeasure - control that mitigates or eliminates risk
  * Reduces vulnerability, likelihood, impact
  * Must be cost justified - applied in multiple layers \(must be lower than the value of the asset\)

## Risk Assessments

* Threat assessments - are designed to discover all potential threats
* Vulnerability Assessments - gather of info about weaknesses of an asset.

## Risk Response

* Risk mitigation - attempt to reduce risk, or at least minimize effects
* Risk management theory states that risk can never be eliminated; only reduced or mitigated to an acceptable level.
* Risk Transference - shares the burden of the risk
* Risk Acceptance - org has done everything it can to mitigate risk, but some risk is still there \(residual risk\)
* Risk Avoidance - avoid activities that cause unnecessary or excessive risk

## Risk Management Standards and Guidance

* NIST's Risk Management Framework \(RMF\) SP-800-37
* ISACA Risk IT Framework
