# OWASP Application Security Testing

### OTG-INFO-001 Conduct search engine discovery recon for info leakage

Use a search engine to conduct recon for:

* Network diagrams and configs
* Archived posts, emails by admins
* Log on procedures and username formats
* Usernames, passwords
* Error message content
* Development, UAT, test, and staging versions of website

Direct methods: searching indexes and content from caches.

Indirect methods: gleaning sensitive design and config by searching forums, newsgroups, and tendering websites.

#### Search Operators

Using `site:` operator in search engines can restrict search results to a specific domain.

Use a diversified search engine approach, each engine crawls the web uniquely

Google has a `cache:` search
