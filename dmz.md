# DMZ

* Instead of bastions, most networks implement a /perimeter network/ structure consisting of security devices and other hosts that serve as a buffer between internal and non-secure networks. â€” called \*Demilitarized Zone \(DMZ\)\*
* Filters incoming traffic.
* In the DMZ, devices such as firewalls, routers, proxy servers, web servers, VPN servers, external DNS servers, etc. are found.
* No host with sensitive data
