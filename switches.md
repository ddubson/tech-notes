# Layer 2 Switch

**Switches** - best alternatives to hubs in a prod or high density network; designed to repeat packets, but only sends data to computer for which the data is intended.

* must be able to uniquely identify devices based on their MAC addresses.
* _full duplex mode_ - able to send and receive packets simultaneously between ports
* switches store the Layer 2 address \(MAC\) of every connected device in a **CAM** table.
* When a packet is transmitted, the switch reads the header info and compares the info to that which is stored in the CAM table.
* TTL of CAM table entries is roughly 300 secs, old entries are flushed
* Switches send data to specific ports, reducing traffic
* If a switch does not know where the destination MAC address is \(not in CAM table\), the switch floods the ports asking who has the MAC address \(except the source port\)

Switches must be able to uniquely identify devices based on their MAC addresses, which means they must operate on the data link \(layer II\) layer of the OSI

* Switches store layer 2 address of every connected device in a \*CAM table\* - which acts a traffic cop.
* When a packet is transmitted, switch reads layer 2 headers in packet, and determine which port to send the packet.

Switch's job is to separate collision domains and cut down on the amount of network "noise" generated by hosts during normal operations.

* Where a router /separates/ LANs from each other, a switch /segments/ LANs into multiple physical \(sometimes logical\) parts.
* Switch can be used to prevent network sniffing \(only way is through a spanned port or ARP poisoning\)
* Can be used to prevent unauthorized hosts from connecting to the network. \(specified MAC addresses can plug into a switch port and connect to the network\)
* Performs requires intelligent switches, such  as those referred to as layer 3 switches.
* Normally switches physically segment LANs into different pieces, but a layer 3 switch can separate hosts into entirely different LANs, called virtual LANs \(VLANs\)
